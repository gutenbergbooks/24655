DAM</h1>

<h2>By JOSEPH TINKER</h2>

<p class="tease">There is something very fundamental
indeed about the ancient showman's
trick&mdash;divert their attention from
the thing you're really doing ...</p>
<p class="illo">Illustrated by Schoenherr</p></div></div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/004.png" width="45" height="45" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="fgcap"><span class="dcap">he</span> call on the TV-phone
came right in the middle
of my shaving. They
have orders not to call
me before breakfast for
anything less than a national calamity.
I pressed "Accept," too startled
to take the lather from my face.</p>

<p>"Hi, Gyp," George Kelly said to
me from the screen. "Hurry it up,
boy." He made no reference to my
appearance on his screen. "Quit
draggin' your feet!"</p>

<p>This I take from George Kelly.
First of all, he's Director of the
F.B.I. Even more important, he's
my boss. "Hey, George," I protested,
knowing he would not have
called on a routine matter. "I got up
before breakfast as it is. What's
up?" I hardly needed to ask. When
they call me, it's always the same
sickening kind of trouble.</p>

<p>"Fred Plaice and his gang got
their hands on a telepath in the District
last night," George told me.
"It's been on the newscast already.
There'll be a damned ugly mob at
the office&mdash;a lynch mob. Listen,
Gyp, I want you to go through the
main entrance this morning."</p>

<p>I nodded my willingness to fight
my way through the crowd that
would be gathering at the office.
Usually I have my taxi drop me on
the roof of the building. Call it a
petty vanity if you want. It's one of
the perquisites of being Washington
brass.</p>

<p>"Swell, Gyp," George Kelly said,
as if there had been any question
about whether I'd come in through
the main entrance. "The public has a
world of confidence in you. Now,
damn it, Gyp, if they want to make
a fuss over you this morning, let
them. We've got to get that snake
out of the building alive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I protested. "You don't
mean Fred took a telepath to the
office?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," George said, his
tone so neutral that I couldn't take
it as personal criticism. "See you
down there." His rugged features
faded from the screen as he cut the
image.</p>

<p>I had my driver drop the skim-copter
to the street when we got to
Pennsylvania Avenue within a block
of the building, and he skimmed to
the outskirts of the crowd that was
pressing around the entrance. There
were four or five hundred people
there, milling around like a herd of
restless cattle. Tighter knots of humanity
were pressed around the
usual four or five firebrands who
were ranting and yelling for blood&mdash;telepathic
blood.</p>

<p>The guards around the entrance,
apparently tipped by George Kelly,
started yelling, "Let him through!"
They charged the mob to open a
lane for me. The crowd drew back
sullenly. As I pressed toward the
guards, I could see the fear and panic
on the faces around me.</p>

<p>Then a man recognized me. "God
bless Gyp Tinker!" he bellowed in a
voice loud enough to conjure an
echo out of a prairie. People started
jumping like so many animated pogo
sticks, trying to get a sight of me
over the heads of others. By the time
I reached the steps, the whole mob
was cheering and yelling, "Gyp!"</p>

<p>As George Kelly had asked, I
paused on the steps and held up my
hands for a chance to speak. It's
flattering when they give you silence.
In the space of two breaths it
was like the inside of a morgue.</p>

<p>"Thanks, friends," I called out to
them. "George Kelly and I have already
gotten the facts on the telepath
who was captured here in
Washington last night. There is absolutely
no cause for alarm. I hope
you'll go to your homes and offices
promptly. Let's not give the Russians
any more satisfaction than we
have to. And rest easy, friends. We'll
use the full summary powers conferred
by Congress."</p>

<p>They gave me a terrific cheer.
You'd think I had said something.
At least they were reminded of the
summary powers granted the F.B.I.
to deal with telepaths, because of
the gruesome danger they are to all
of us.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anita Hadley, my secretary, was
waiting for me in the outer office,
although it was a good hour before
we were supposed to open.</p>

<p>"He's in there," she said, pointing
to the door to my private office.</p>

<p>"The snake?" I asked, startled.</p>

<p>"Fred Plaice," she said. "And he's
got the snake in there with him."
Her gray eyes flashed. She could
guess how I felt about that.</p>

<p>"Come along," I said to her, and
went into my office.</p>

<p>"Hi, Gyp," Fred Plaice greeted
me, grinning. "Got a present for
you." He gave his prisoner a shove,
making him stumble a couple steps
toward me. The telepath was a
stoop-shouldered balding gent with
large feet. He certainly didn't look
like a walking bubonic plague, but
then, they never do. Instinctively I
closed my thoughts to him.</p>

<p>"What's this snake doing here,
Fred?" I asked my Section Chief
quietly.</p>

<p>He flushed. He knew my policies.
"What did you expect me to do with
him?" he said hotly. "This isn't some
common snake we picked up out in
the country. We snagged this viper
right here in Washington, Gyp! I
suppose I should have spirited him
out of town on the midnight jet!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "That would have
been my idea. Do you realize that
all this publicity has gotten us a mob
of five hundred people around our
doors, a mob that's waiting to lynch
this prisoner of yours?"</p>

<p>The man gulped and started to
say something, but Fred hit him
hard between the shoulder blades.
"Shut up," he said. "Nobody cares
what you think." He walked up close
to me. "Sure I know there's a mob
down there," he said. "And I know
why they're there. Plain scared to
death of what it means to have had
a telepath loose in Washington.
You're wrong to hustle this guy out
of town, Gyp. Look at this pathetic
case&mdash;does he look like a superman?"</p>

<p>I looked at the snake. "No," I
agreed. "He looks like they roped
him somewhere in West Virginia a
few months ago, put shoes on him,
and brought him to town."</p>

<p>"Right," Fred snapped. "Let the
mob get a look at him. The contrast
of you dragging him along by the
ear and him stumbling along behind
you is the sort of thing the public
laps up. It'll put you right in the
driver's seat."</p>

<p>"I thought Congress had already
done that," I reminded him coldly.
No bureaucrat could want powers
more absolute than mine. "Unfortunately,"
I growled at him. "I gave
orders that no snakes were to be
brought into this building without
my prior consent. This ineffective-looking
hill-billy has possibly read
a thousand minds since you dragged
him in here. How much of what he
has picked up around here this
morning will be peeped by some
Russian telepath before you get him
out of town?"</p>

<p>"Relax," Fred scoffed. "He's a
short-range punk."</p>

<p>That was too much. "I'll do my
own thinking, Fred," I said. "From
now on, you follow orders."</p>

<hr />

<p>I turned on the telepath. "Before
I sentence you," I said. "What have
you got to say?"</p>

<p>"I never hurt nothin'," he grumbled.</p>

<p>They're all alike, so help me.
"You are a telepath?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Shoah."</p>

<p>"Prove it," I demanded, opening
a chink in my mind.</p>

<p>His long red face twisted in a
crooked grin, showing poorly-cared-for
teeth scattered here and there in
his gums.</p>

<p>"Yo' think I never had no orthodonture,
whatever <i>thet</i> is," he said.</p>

<p>I shut my mind like a clam. If
there's anything I detest, it's the
ghastly creeping of a telepath into
my own thoughts. "Hello, Pete!" he
exclaimed. "Yo' done shet yo'
mind!" He shook his head. "Ain't
never seen a body could do <i>thet</i>!"
I'll bet he hadn't. There are only a
few of us who can keep telepaths
out of our thoughts. It takes a world
of practice. Well, I'd had that.</p>

<p>"Can you do that?" I asked the
snake.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, suh," he
admitted.</p>

<p>"So here you are," I said, more
heatedly. "Wandering around in a
town full of <i>secrets</i>&mdash;Washington,
the capital of your country, where
the military, the diplomatic people,
the security people, all of them have
locked in their heads the things that
keep us one step ahead of the Russians.
Isn't that true?"</p>

<p>"I reckon. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But nothing," I snapped, getting
sore about it for the thousandth
time. "And you, you miserable
snake, you <i>can't</i> keep your thoughts
from being read by another telepath.
No telepath can. Your mind is open
<i>two</i> ways&mdash;to let thoughts in but,
damn it, equally to leak out anything
you know." I smiled coldly at
him. "Can you get my thoughts
now?"</p>

<p>The telepath shook his head.
"Still got yo' mind closed," he said.
He sounded bitter about it.</p>

<p>"You're right," I told him. "Something
that few can do, and that <i>no
telepath can do</i>! How can we let you
wander around Washington leaking
out thoughts of every secret your
mind might accidentally have overheard
from some ranking official?
How many Russian telepaths have
been accredited to their Embassy?
How many crypto-telepaths have
the Reds got in town? How many
secrets have you <i>already</i> given
away? How big a traitor have you
been?"</p>

<p>That was the one that got him.
"Traitor!" he yelled at me, starting
across the office to where I stood
leaning against my desk. Fred
grabbed him and twisted his arm
cruelly to stop all movement.</p>

<p>"Cut that out!" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Cut it out yourself, Fred," I
said. "Just because you're sore at
me, you don't have to take it out on
the snake."</p>

<p>The telepath was not to be silenced.
"My folks been in this country
over three hundred years," he
stormed at me. "And it takes someone
like you to call me a traitor!"</p>

<p>I am very dark, and my hair is
black and curly. I don't mind. With
my heredity, it should be.</p>

<p>"Under the power vested in me&mdash;"
I started.</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," he said, turning to
walk to the door. "I reckon I know
the rest!"</p>

<p>Anita stayed behind after Fred
Plaice dragged the snake out with
him. "Better get me George Kelly
on the 'visor," I said to her.</p>

<p>"Right away," Anita said, coming
over to my desk. "But first&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked up. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Fred Plaice is throwing you a
curve, Gyp."</p>

<p>The instant she used my nickname,
<i>I</i> knew Anita felt that it was
important. She never did that unless
we were alone and talking seriously.</p>

<p>"What the devil!"</p>

<p>"Fred caught <i>another</i> telepath
last night, at the same time he got
the snake you just saw," Anita said.
"You didn't know that, did you,
Gyp?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no," I growled. "Does
George Kelly know?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"How did you find out, Anita?"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I stand pretty
good with a couple of the guys in
Fred's section. One of them tipped
me on the 'visor at home before I
came to work. That's how I knew to
be down here, actually."</p>

<p>I scowled over that one. "What
did your buddy tell you?"</p>

<p>"Fred had said he'd have your
O.K. to execute the second snake by
noon and that everything about her
was top-secret."</p>

<p>That was enough. "Get Fred and
this top-secret snake in here, Anita,
and right now! Forget about that
call to the Director."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>!" she said, and went out
with a swish of skirts.</p>

<hr />

<p>But Fred came in alone. I decided
it was about time to get him
back on his heels. "Don't you give a
damn about my orders?" I growled
at him. His eyebrows shot up. "I
distinctly told Anita I wanted you to
bring that other snake in <i>with</i> you.
I know Anita got the message to
you."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/002.png" width="139" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But it didn't shake him up. Fred
Plaice came right toward my desk,
leaned over and put his hands on it,
and looked me in the eye. "Gyp,"
he said. "Gyp, this is once you're going
to let me have <i>my</i> way."</p>

<p>"Not that it makes any difference,"
I snapped. "But why?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm not going
to tell you," he said. "Listen,
Gyp, have I ever tried to stick it in
you, in any form?"</p>

<p>Fred's a hot-shot. He's the
hardest-charger among my Section
Chiefs. But I had never found his
ambitions extending to my own job
as head of the Division of Psychic
Investigation. "You're still here," I
conceded. "I guess I never caught
you at it, Fred."</p>

<p>"And you never will, Gyp," he
said. "You've given me the greatest
breaks a guy ever got. This time
I'm returning the favor."</p>

<p>"By <i>executing</i> a telepath?" I demanded.
"And a woman, at that!"</p>

<p>He didn't ask me how I knew, but
I could see it annoyed him.</p>

<p>"The biggest break you ever got,"
he insisted. "This thing is so hot it
will burn you to death. Another
crypto-telepath, right here in the
District. I want to make summary
disposition of her, and I don't want
you to so much as look at the papers.
Just give me instructions to use
my own discretion."</p>

<p>Talk about a blank check. "Fred,"
I said, searching for words that
wouldn't offend him. "I have more
confidence in you than in any man
I've ever worked with. But <i>execution</i>!
Sure, three years ago, when
the President declared the psychic
emergency, we were killing the most
fatally dangerous ones. But that's a
couple years behind us. I just can't
go that far without more reason
than you've given me."</p>

<p>"It's perfectly legal," Fred said
sullenly and beside the point. "Congress
has given you summary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," I cut in. "What
F.B.I. man would suggest an illegal
course of action? But why should I
delegate? If this is so touchy, I
should handle it myself. Why delegate?"</p>

<p>"Simply because, I ask it," he
said. "And because you trust me.
Listen, Gyp," he added, almost passionately.
"Don't ask me any more
questions. I've said too much already.
If you know <i>why</i>, it wouldn't
be right for you to delegate. Do as I
ask. Trust me. I'm saving you a
world of trouble."</p>

<p>"Boy, oh boy!" I said. "This doesn't
sound like the way to stay out of
trouble. What is so dangerous about
this telepath?"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," Fred said. "I
know I'm asking for a blank check.
There's no other way for me to help
you play it."</p>

<p>"This is your own idea, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Talked it over with Anita?"</p>

<p>He shook his head furiously. "I
wouldn't compromise you, Gyp, and
not with <i>her</i>!"</p>

<p>That settled it. I would trust Anita
with the crown jewels.</p>

<p>"No dice, Fred," I said. "Give me
the facts."</p>

<p>"Gyp," he pleaded. "<i>Don't</i> ask for
them!"</p>

<p>"The facts!"</p>

<p>He straightened up from where he
had hung over my desk during the
whole argument. "This cuts my guts
right out," he said. "Suspect apprehended
around two o'clock this
morning and now in detention at the
City Jail. Native white female, age
fifty-eight. Named Maude Tinker."
He stopped.</p>

<p>I couldn't start. Maude Tinker!
My given name is Joseph Tinker&mdash;although
they all call me Gyp.
"What ..." I got out at last.
"What did she look...?"</p>

<p>He nodded, looking sick. "She's a
gypsy, if that's what you mean,
Gyp," he said to me. "I'm sorry.
You <i>know</i> I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Has she made any statement,
Fred?" I asked softly, staring at the
surface of my desk.</p>

<p>"She demanded to be taken at
once to the Chief of the Division of
Psychic Investigation, Mr. Joseph
Tinker," he said.</p>

<p>"Give any reason?"</p>

<p>He was quiet for a while, until I
looked up. "She said," Fred told me,
"she said Gyp Tinker was her son."</p>

<p>I smiled wanly at him. "Obviously
I can't let a statement like that go
unchallenged, not in my position as
the man charged with extirpating
the danger of the snakes," I said.</p>

<p>"Obviously," Fred agreed. "Now
that you know about it. If you had
done as I asked, Gyp ..."</p>

<p>"Get her over here, Fred," I said.
"I'll see her at once. And send Anita
in as you leave."</p>

<p>"Sure, Gyp," he said, starting for
the door.</p>

<p>"And thanks, Fred," I said. "But
it never would have worked."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," he conceded from
the door. "But the guy in the jam
would have been me, not you."</p>

<hr />

<p>I turned my swivel around and
stared out the window at the Mall
and didn't move until the light scent
of Anita's perfume reminded me
that I had asked her to come in.</p>

<p>I swung around. "You watch out
for that Fred Plaice," Anita said, almost
scoldingly.</p>

<p>"You mean, start watching my
back, like I never did before? How
did I get this far?"</p>

<p>Her frown softened a little. "You
don't miss many bets," she said. "Not
my Gypper. But this thing of Fred's
holding back on the other telepath
he picked up last night has all the
earmarks of a real slippery move."</p>

<p>"Did Fred tell you anything about
it on the way out?"</p>

<p>"Just that he was bringing the
telepath from the City Jail right
back with him, and that you wanted
to see her at once."</p>

<p>"This snake is a woman, aged
fifty-eight, Anita," I told her. "She
gave the name of Maude Tinker
and says she's my mother," I added,
without any particular expression.</p>

<p>Anita laughed. "Oh, <i>no</i>!" she said.
"What they won't think of next!"
But her face sobered in an instant,
and she bent forward, almost whispering
the rest: "Gyp! You mean
that Fred Plaice took her seriously!
That he was trying to get <i>rid</i> of
her?"</p>

<p>"He felt it would be better if I
never knew about it," I admitted.
"What do you think I should do,
Anita?"</p>

<p>Her heart-shaped face grew more
solemn. "I think it would be bad to
try to cover it up," she decided.
"And I'm glad you didn't let Fred
do that to you. Some newscast
would be sure to get hold of the story
and there'd be snide accusations.
All this talk recently about the
heredity of psi powers is bad, too.
That's what she's trying to cash in
on. And if the public thought that
the man in charge of catching and
pulling the fangs of all the snakes
was a hereditary telepath, they'd be
after your scalp in no time."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Scotch it. See her, face her
down, prove her charge is ridiculous,
and ship her west."</p>

<p>I smiled a little dimly. "Just one
complication."</p>

<p>"Yes, Gyp?"</p>

<p>"This Maude Tinker, says Fred,
is a gypsy."</p>

<p>Anita's face did the most abrupt
change. I had never seen her furiously
angry. She's a typical high
echelon Washington secretary, cool,
extremely well-mannered, cheerful
without being bumptious. But this
time she was downright mad.</p>

<p>"I told you," Anita said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I told you to watch out for Fred
Plaice!"</p>

<p>"It's not his fault," I protested.
"Catching telepaths is his job."</p>

<p>"Within limits," she said scornfully.
"I thought it was just one
more of his screwball ideas! He had
his whole Section concentrating on
gypsies, for a couple of months. He
had a long story to go with it, Gyp!
How all the soothsayers and clairvoyants
and finders were really
short-range telepaths or pre-cogs."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," I said. "You
mean that Fred started with my
nickname, and has been on this campaign
of looking for telepaths among
gypsies just in hopes he could embarrass
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>You have to like loyalty, no matter
what the circumstances that incite
it.</p>

<p>"I can't believe that of one of my
boys, Anita," I said. "Fred was all
broken up about it."</p>

<p>"I bet I can call the turn," Anita
said, starting back for her own desk.
"Fred's next move is to tell you that
no one can blame you for disqualifying
yourself from this case. After
all, your own mother!"</p>

<p>Well, the political implications
<i>were</i> deep. "I think I would agree,"
I said at length. "Let's see what happens.
Send this Maude Tinker in as
soon as she gets here."</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to take any
precautions, Gyp?" Anita demanded.</p>

<p>"Against what?"</p>

<p>"You're impossible," she snapped.
"I'll take care of the precaution department
myself. And don't you
dare let Fred get that woman in
here until I get back."</p>

<p>"No what...?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Tinker!" she cried. "Be
quiet!" She stormed out.</p>

<hr />

<p>In about twenty minutes the buzzer
on my pix-box sounded, and I
depressed the key. Anita's face was
tense on the small screen.</p>

<p>"Just got a flash," she said. "Fred
has her in his 'copter and will let
down on the roof in about four or
five minutes. I'll need a couple minutes
more than that. Now don't you
let him in with her before I get there,
do you hear me?"</p>

<p>I said I heard her. She beat Fred
at that. For all I know she had
booby-trapped them in getting down
from the roof. Anita has drag with
everybody in the building, and that
could have included the elevator
service man, who quite easily could
have loused service to the roof
enough to delay Fred.</p>

<p>Anita came in. "Mr. Tinker," she
said crisply. "Meet Tony Carlucci."</p>

<p>I stood up. Tony was a darned
good-looking chap, about my age,
with very dark hair, somewhat curly,
and a flash of white teeth for a smile.
I told him I was pleased to meet
him.</p>

<p>"Move over," Anita directed,
stepping smartly around my desk
and giving my elbow a sharp yank.
"You sit behind the desk, Tony.
Now try to look like a big wheel, for
heaven's sake."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> a big wheel," Tony protested.
"In the used 'copter racket."</p>

<p>Anita was already reaching up to
push down on my shoulders. "Won't
you sit down?" she demanded. She
had me in one of the comfortable
chairs I have in my office for callers,
rather off to one side. She put herself
down in the chair across my
desk from Tony Carlucci, as though
she were getting instructions.</p>

<p>He didn't need much hinting.
"Tell the bulls we're gonna clean up
the District," he started, waving his
hands around. "No more poker.
No more dice. No more Sneaky Pete."
I'd never heard of that.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Anita said. "He'll be
here any instant."</p>

<p>Fred was as good as her word.
He was holding the door for his telepath
within seconds. Tony Carlucci
stopped hamming it up and straightened
importantly in my chair. I had
to admit that Anita had found a guy
who, superficially, resembled me
more than a little. No one who knew
either of us would ever mistake one
for the other, but our general descriptions
were quite similar.</p>

<p>The woman who came in not only
was a gypsy, she was dressed as a
gypsy. Her blouse was white, and
quite frilly. She had on a billowing
red skirt, liberally encrusted with
embroidered beads of a darker red.
The tattered hem of a petticoat hung
below it. Her hair had been dark
once, but it was shot with threads of
silver. There was a lot of it, and piled
up high so that her ears were exposed.
They had pierced lobes, and
heavy gold rings hung from them.</p>

<p>Instinctively I closed my mind as
tight as a clam. The mere sight of a
telepath triggers that reaction. Fred
closed the door behind him, continuing
to stand just behind his captive.
She glanced briefly at me and
then looked for a longer moment at
Tony Carlucci, behind my desk.</p>

<p>"Joe," she said to him. "Joe, don't
let them do this to me!"</p>

<p>I don't know how much coaching
Anita had given Carlucci, but he
knew enough to call her "mother."
And I knew enough to watch Fred
Plaice the instant Tony said: "Oh,
mother! Why the devil couldn't you
keep out of sight!"</p>

<p>Fred was one mighty confused
looking boy. The two-bit word is
consternation. He had it. Anita had
given him the business.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, madame," I said
standing and walking over to where
Tony was emoting, with the back of
his hand pressed to his eyes. "We
threw you a curve. Meet Mr. Tony
Carlucci." Her eyebrows rose in surprise.
"And I, madame, am Joseph
Tinker."</p>

<p>"Joe!" she cried, or wailed is a
better word, and threw herself
around the desk to seize me in her
arms. She smelled faintly of garlic,
oregano and some kind of incense,
maybe sandalwood. A nice clean
gypsy smell. Cleaner than a lot of
gypsies I can think of.</p>

<p>Fred pulled her off me, not too
gently. I'd say he was a little sore
about something. Anita's eyes were
slits of fury.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Tony," I said. "See you
around."</p>

<p>"Honest Tony Carlucci," he said.
"If you need a used 'copter, Joe, jet
on down to my dock. Nothing down.
Listen, I got one that was never used
except in the spring by a little old
lady who gave up walking for Lent.
I'll tell you what I'll do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wasting your time," Anita told
him. "The Government provides
Mr. Tinker with any kind of transportation
he needs. A thousand
thanks, Tony. I won't forget&mdash;" The
rest was cut off as she gave him one
of the more polite bum's rushes. I
think he would have liked to hang
around to see the rest of our little
amateur theatrical.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fred had his grin going. "Couldn't
get the drift for a minute, Gyp,"
he said, clapping me on the shoulder.
"Nice work! Now I know why I get
such a kick out of working for you!"
He whirled on Maude Tinker. "And
you, you foolish old biddy! How far
do you think you would get with an
act like this against another telepath?"</p>

<p>She spat a curse at him in Romany.
"So smart!" she sneered. "There
isn't another telepath in the city of
Washington!"</p>

<p>That was a laugh. For its own
safety the F.B.I. has its own gang of
tame TP's&mdash;they are all, of course,
exceptionally short-range telepaths,
and we practically keep them under
lock and key to make sure some important
thoughts don't leak in and
out of their diseased minds.</p>

<p>"Send in Freeda Sayer," I said,
leaning down to press the intercommute.
Freeda is a thick-ankled,
thick-headed telepath. But stupid or
not, she is telepathic, and <i>is</i> an acid
test in these cases.</p>

<p>"Is this woman a telepath?" I
asked Freeda, when she stumped in.</p>

<p>Freeda looked at Maude Tinker,
her mouth hanging a little open. She
snuffled and walked quite close to
the gypsy woman. "Yeah," she said.
"She knows I'm thinking her hem is
torn." She turned her head with that
low-thyroid slowness to me. "Is that
all, Mr. Tinker?" she asked.</p>

<p>Fred answered. "Swell, Freeda.
That's all."</p>

<p>Freeda wandered out.</p>

<p>Fred said: "O.K., Gyp. What'll I
do with her?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mrs. ... it is Mrs.,
isn't it? ... Mrs. Tinker, won't
you please?" I said in answer to his
question. She took the chair Anita
had been using when Tony was pretending
to be me, and I sat down in
my swivel across the desk from her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tinker," I said.
"It's bad enough that you have deliberately
stayed in the District after
all telepaths were most stringently
warned to register with us so that we
could move them to less sensitive
areas. But I take it quite hard that
you have tried to embarrass me."</p>

<p>"That would take a little doing,"
she said. "You've got a heart like a
piece of flint. Let me see your
palm!" she demanded, reaching imperatively
across my desk. Fred
started to protest, but I passed my
hand across to her, leaning forward
so that she could reach it.</p>

<p>Maude Tinker smoothed out my
palm, rubbing her thumb over it as
if to clear away a veil of mystery,
and bent close over it, her dark face
intense. She traced a line or two
with her fingernail, and dropped my
hand to the walnut. "You have no
mercy," she said. "You will use the
excuse that I tried to hinder the
work of your department as a reason
to punish me severely&mdash;and your
real reason is that you feel I might
have damaged you personally."</p>

<p>Fred was moving around the desk.
He spoke softly in my ear while I
kept my eye on the gypsy. That was
silly. He can't close his mind the way
I can. She could read his thoughts
just as well as if he were screaming
them out loud.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/003.png" width="600" height="330" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"That's a charge she may repeat,
Gyp," he said. "Nobody could blame
you, if you disqualified yourself
from this decision. I think we could
get the newscasts to see it as impeccable
public behavior. We'll paint
you as the administrator so devoted
to pure justice that even potential
resentment will be a barrier to your
personal decision. How's that sound
to you, Gyp?"</p>

<p>"The day you have to start painting
a picture for them, I've had it,
Fred," I said. I felt sure Anita had
overheard his soft words in my ear,
but to be sure, I added, "I think it
would be suicide to disqualify myself
from this case. That's just the first
step to disqualifying myself from
the job. If there's any hint of telepathic
heredity in my case, ducking
this decision would be a public admission
that I'm sensitive in that
area. No. I'll handle it."</p>

<p>Anita nodded slowly to me. Well,
she had called it. Maybe she <i>was</i>
right about Fred. "Tell you what," I
said. "Several things about this case
interest me. If we are to believe her,
this woman has had absolutely no
contact with any other telepath in
Washington&mdash;she thought she was
the only one who had escaped our
dragnet. Why don't all of you shoo&mdash;I
want to do a little survey in
depth here&mdash;a little motivational
work. I think I can get more frankness
out of her if there are no witnesses.
Beat it, kids."</p>

<p>Anita left with Fred. Maude
Tinker and I were alone in my office.
I looked at her with a smile.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Hello, Joe," she said.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mother," I said. "You
look just wonderful."</p>

<p>Mother smiled at me and reached
across the desk again to take both
my hands. "<i>Yosip</i>," she said in Romany.
"What a wonderful long way
you have come since you ran away.
A lawyer, and now a big man, a <i>very</i>
big man, in Washington. I am a very
proud gypsy."</p>

<p>What I might have said to her
was interrupted by a racket outside
my office. Voices were raised. I
thought I heard what could only be
Anita yelling. That's another thing
that had never happened before.</p>

<p>Fred burst back into the office,
with Anita right on his heels. His
face was livid. Mother turned in her
chair and looked coldly at him. A
gypsy woman can give you the snootiest
look in the world, right down
her aquiline nose, when she feels like
it. It stopped Fred Plaice in his
tracks.</p>

<p>"Yes, Fred?" I said quietly.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, Tinker," he
said brusquely. "I'd like to be present
for this interview."</p>

<p>"Tinker?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Gyp," he said. "I'm
... I'm upset."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you are, you sneak,"
Anita said. "Chief," she told me. "He
was fit to be tied when you chased
us out. The first thing he wanted to
know was whatever had made you
decide to get Tony Carlucci in here
to trick his gypsy snake. I was so
mad that I flipped and told him it
was <i>my</i> idea."</p>

<p>"Is that why you're back?" I
asked him.</p>

<p>"Get this calf-eyed girl Friday of
yours off my back," he said stonily.
"Our security certainly doesn't permit
your confidential assistant to be
in love with you. We're supposed to
be checking each other constantly."</p>

<p>I hardly knew which of his two
ideas to blast the hardest. I looked
at Anita first. She simply raised her
head and looked me straight in the
eye. It could mean almost anything.</p>

<p>I tried Fred: "And you consider
it's your job to check on me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Goes without saying,"
he said. I shrugged. "At any
rate," he added, calming down. "I'm
staying. Nothing outside of a direct
order, which I will protest to George
Kelly, will get me to leave." The
last thing I wanted was trouble with
the Director.</p>

<p>"Stay, Fred," I said. "But we'll
have some things to settle afterwards."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he smiled. "It will depend.
Right now I'd like to get a
load of this motivational research
you've got cooked up."</p>

<p>"Don't bother," Mother said.
"I've got more sense than to tie the
rope around my own neck. I'm not
saying a word." She crossed her
arms and sat back in her chair with
a granitic finality.</p>

<p>"So much the quicker," Fred said.
"You can sentence her right now,
Gyp!"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said. "Sure I can." I
wish I could say that my mind raced
to a quick decision. No&mdash;I <i>couldn't</i>
think. Or almost couldn't. One idea
percolated through. Mother had
made no "mistake" in calling Tony
by my name. She had read Fred's
mind in the 'copter on the way from
the jail, and Anita's as she was
ushered in. Her "mistake" could
only mean one thing&mdash;<i>Fred Plaice
was not sure she was my mother</i>.</p>

<p>This much thought took time.
Fred knew I was stalling. "Come
on," he snapped in a tone he had
never dared to use to me before.
"Let's have the sentence!"</p>

<p>He was right in one thing. He had
me over a barrel. I squeezed my
eyelids shut and did something I
hadn't done since that day twenty
years before when I had run away
from home. I opened my mind to
my mother.</p>

<hr />

<p>Unless you have had the experience,
you can't imagine what it is
like to live with a telepath. It is disquieting
in the extreme. One of the
concomitants of consciousness is
that it is <i>private</i> consciousness. And
when this isn't true, when someone,
even a loved one, can creep into
your mind and know what you
think, your insides writhe. Caterpillars
course around under your skin.
And you resent. Sooner or later you
will hate. I ran away from home because
I couldn't stand Mother in my
mind, and couldn't bear the thought
of hating her.</p>

<p>But now I <i>had</i> to know what I
should do to her. I let her into my
thoughts. <i>Give me some sign</i>, I
thought, as I waved a hand at Fred
for quiet. <i>Mother, tell me what to
do!</i></p>

<p><i>Poor Joe</i>, she thought. <i>He loves
me in spite of it all. He can't bear to
do what he has to do. Joe!</i> her mind
shrieked at me. <i>You read my mind!</i></p>

<p>I snapped upright in my chair and
grabbed its arms until I could hear
my knuckles crack. My mind snapped
shut with an almost audible crack.
<i>I was a damned snake!</i></p>

<p>I could dimly hear Fred yammering
at me. With a sick fear I slowly
opened my mind again. His thoughts
surged into it. Well, Anita had been
right. And Anita!</p>

<p><i>Yes</i>, Mother thought. <i>She does
love you, Joe. A lovely girl. You
lucky man.</i></p>

<p>Fred had me by the shoulder, yelling
at me, shaking me, trying to get
me to speak. He was almost slavering
in his greed. I paid him no heed.
<i>All right</i>, I thought. <i>What's to be
done, Mother?</i></p>

<p><i>Throw the book at me</i>, Mother
thought.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Fred. And sit down." He
kept his tight grip on my shoulder.
"Sit down!" I yelled at him. "Three
strikes and out, Fred. This is the
third order you've resisted today!"</p>

<p>"Now hear this," I said. "Under
the powers vested in me ..." I
sentenced Mother to indefinite detention
in Oklahoma. I threatened her
with worse&mdash;face it, the only worse
thing was death&mdash;if she were found
in a restricted area again.</p>

<p>"Take her out, Fred," I said. He
hadn't counted on my being able to
do it, and it left him without a plan.
"Four times?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"No. No, Gyp. On my way," he
said, taking Mother by the arm.</p>

<p>Anita started to follow him. I
stopped her and waited until the
door had closed behind Fred and
Mother.</p>

<p>"You were right about Fred,
Anita," I said. "Thank you for saving
my life."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gyp," she said, tears trying
to brim over her eyelids. "He's such
a cutthroat!"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said. "But now we know
it. Get me an appointment with
George Kelly, will you, Anita?"</p>

<p>She compressed her lips. "That's
more like it!" she said angrily. "Get
Fred kicked clear out of the Bureau.
George Kelly is a great Director,
Gyp, and he'll do it if you insist."</p>

<p>"Maybe," I said. I stewed over
what to tell the boss until Anita
came back in.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kelly can see you now, Mr.
Tinker," she said, all calmed down
again.</p>

<p>I got up and came around the desk
and took her by the elbow, standing
at my door. "Just in case," I
said, leaning down to kiss her lightly
on the lips. "I love you, too."</p>

<p>"Too?" she said.</p>

<p>I froze. It was the kind of slip
that sooner or later trips up every
snake. My grin was a sick one. I
walked out without another word.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Director's office is on the
fourth floor, I climbed the single
flight, and his girl let me in. George
affects long slim cigars. I say affects.
He seldom lights them, but he waves
them like batons, conducting some
kind of a symphony of words and
ideas all day.</p>

<p>"Welcome, stranger," he said,
calling on the fiddles for a little pizzicato.
"What's up, Gyp?"</p>

<p>I sat down across from him at his
desk and tried to put a smile on my
face. "I want to submit my resignation,
George," I said. "Effective immediately."</p>

<p>"Not accepted," he said, without a
second thought. Then his face grew
solemn. "What's this about?" he demanded.
"I can't lose <i>you</i>, Gyp. My
right bower!"</p>

<p>"One favor," I said, not answering
him. "Don't move Fred Plaice
up to my old spot. Any of the other
Section Chiefs, but not Fred."</p>

<p>"Well, well," George said, whipping
up the brasses with his cigar.
"This begins to sound like cause and
effect." He hushed the whole orchestra
to a whisper. "I thought
Fred was your fair-haired boy, Gyp.
You two get in a hassle?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Not directly,
George," I told him. "I want you to
know two things. They'll explain
why I'm quitting. My mother is a
telepath. We arrested her early this
morning, here in the District. I just
sentenced her to transportation and
detention in Oklahoma."</p>

<p>"Good heavens," he gasped.
"Your own mother! Gyp, no wonder
you're upset. Didn't you know she
was a snake?"</p>

<p>My smile was a little tired. "Of
course I knew," I told him. "I ran
away from home at thirteen to get
away from having her inside my
head all the time. That's how I
learned to close my mind&mdash;closing
her out as much as I could. The
power got stronger as I grew older."</p>

<p>"It's embarrassing," George said,
turning away from me to look out
the window. "To have you, of all
people, Gyp, with telepathic heredity.
Still, if no one knows, and since
you've never had the slightest manifestation
of psi powers yourself,
there may be some way we can preserve
your usefulness."</p>

<p>"Today, within the last half hour,
George, my latent telepathic ability
became manifest. George, I'm a
snake."</p>

<p>His face froze. Then the batonlike
cigar stopped its movement. He was
like a statue. The pose broke, and
he pressed a button.</p>

<p>"Send Carol Lundgren in," he ordered.
I knew Carol, another short-range
telepath that George used as
his private lie-detector.</p>

<p>Carol was at my elbow in a moment
or so. George wasted no
words. "Carol, is there a telepath in
this room?" he asked.</p>

<p>Carol grinned. "Yep," he said to
the enforced silence. "There is."
George Kelly's face fell. "His name
is Carol Lundgren," the kid went on.
"Next question?"</p>

<p>George looked as though he could
have brained him. "All right, you
Philadelphia lawyer," he grumbled.
"Besides yourself, Carol, is there a
telepath in this room?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Kelly, there is not."</p>

<p>"Get out, and don't scare me like
that again." George told him.</p>

<p>I didn't get it. I said so: "George,
I don't get it. I read my mother's
thoughts, and for that matter, Fred
Plaice's thoughts, too. That's why I
asked you not to give him my job.
I swear to you I can read thoughts."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"If I <i>know</i> I'm a telepath, Carol
should be able to read the thought
that I know it," I protested.</p>

<p>"You're like me," George Kelly
said. "You automatically close your
mind in the presence of a telepath.
It's pure reflex now. Carol couldn't
read a thing because you clammed
your thoughts the instant he walked
in."</p>

<p>"That was <i>then</i>!" I yelled at him.
"<i>Before</i> my psi powers became
manifest. You know that a telepath
can't close his mind! Why couldn't
Carol read my thoughts?"</p>

<p><i>Well</i>, George thought, <i>he couldn't
read mine either, could he?</i></p>

<p><i>No</i>, I thought. <i>He couldn't. He
... George!</i> my mind shrieked at
him.</p>

<p>Somebody kicked the props out
from under my world. <i>George Kelly
was a snake!</i></p>

<p><i>Don't be silly</i>, he thought. <i>I'm no
more a snake than you are, Gyp.</i></p>

<p><i>But you're a telepath!</i></p>

<p><i>So are you, Gyp</i>, he thought. <i>The
only kind of telepath that really
counts. You can read minds, but
others can't read yours.</i></p>

<p>I fell back on words, closing my
mind&mdash;it was rattling so I didn't
want George to read my thoughts:
"But a telepath <i>can't</i> close his
mind!" I protested.</p>

<p>"I hope the Russians are as sure
of that as you are, Gyp," George
grinned. "The only agents we have
in Russia are closed-mind telepaths&mdash;telepaths
who don't automatically
give themselves away. Now <i>that</i>
kind of a telepath really <i>is</i> a usable
espionage agent or a safe link in a
communications net."</p>

<p>"How long has this been going
on?"</p>

<p>"About three years, Gyp. When
we discovered that certain training
could make some telepaths closed-mind
operators, we got the President
to promulgate the Executive
Orders that Congress later made
into law. We got all ordinary telepaths
out of circulation and put to
work those that we could train to
closed-mind operation. Now you
know why I won't take your resignation."</p>

<p>I sputtered. "George, how can I
conscientiously crack down on these
poor people, if I'm a TP myself?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "You won't. You'll
still be doing just what you've always
been doing, except now you'll
<i>know</i> that you're doing it. You'll be
recruiting telepaths for us. Where
do you think we train them?"</p>

<p>"Oklahoma? The Detention area?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Where else? Now relax.
But for heaven's sake, don't ever
leak this. We feel sure the Russians
haven't discovered this business of
closed-mind telepaths yet. Some day,
I suppose, they will. It may take a
long time. The self-realized closed-mind
telepath like you, Gyp, is a
rarity. Mostly we have to train people
rigorously for it. It took your
mother over two years to learn it."</p>

<p>"My mother!"</p>

<p>"Sure. Why did you think she was
in Washington? She's part of the
Sevastopol, Teheran and Cairo communications
network."</p>

<p>"George," I insisted. "Something
is shaky. If she's on the inside, how
did she ever get picked up?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Just part of her
cover. Fred Plaice got too close. We
know what he is, Gyp. But we didn't
dare to have him guess what your
mother was. She's on her way to a
nice California vacation. New assignment
after that. Maybe middle
Europe. After all, she <i>is</i> a gypsy.
Ought to go well, say, in Bulgaria!"</p>
